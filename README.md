Air Quality Monitor

Description:

This Python application fetches real-time air quality data for a specified city, presents it both visually and audibly, and provides descriptions of the air quality levels. It utilizes the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) API for data retrieval.

Features:

Retrieves AQI (Air Quality Index), PM10 (particulate matter), and O3 (ozone) levels for a given city.
Provides text and audio output for the air quality data.
Offers a descriptive interpretation of the AQI levels to explain their health implications.
Generates graphs to visualize the forecast for AQI and O3 levels over time.
Incorporates text-to-speech functionality for accessibility.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
Required libraries:
requests
pyttsx3
matplotlib
An API key from the World Air Quality Index (WAQI)
Usage:

Install the required libraries:
Bash
  pip install requests pyttsx3 matplotlib
Use code with caution.
Replace the placeholder API key in the code with your actual WAQI API key.

Run the Python script:
Bash
  python main.py
Use code with caution.
The application will prompt you to enter the name of the city for which you want to check the air quality.
Follow the audio prompts and screen outputs to interact with the application.
Key Files:

main.py: The main Python script for the application.
README.MD: This file (provides an overview of the project).
Additional Notes:

The application currently supports checking air quality for a single city at a time.
The graphs generated using matplotlib may not be visible if the script is run in a non-interactive environment.
Consider adding error handling for potential API errors or network issues.
Explore options for saving and persisting the retrieved air quality data.
